Project Name: Deskercise Dealer 

1. Overview & Purpose 

Objective: 
Deskercise Dealer is a playful, React-based web application that helps office workers stay active by prompting them to perform randomized desk exercises at customizable intervals. The core user experience uses a vibrant card-deck metaphor to make exercise fun, easy, and engaging. 

App Type: 
Modern Web App (React, HTML, CSS, JS, responsive design for desktop and mobile) 

2. Key Features 

Card-deck UI: 

Main screen features a virtual deck of cards with a “Draw Card” button. 

Each card displays: 

Exercise name 

Brief description 

Emoji or SVG illustration 

Actions: Draw new card, repeat current, skip, or return to deck. 

Customizable Reminders: 

User selects reminder frequency (e.g., 30, 60, or 90 minutes). 

Browser notifications or in-app popups are used for reminders. 

Timer persists in background between cards. 

Difficulty/Intensity Filtering: 

Users set preferred exercise intensity: Easy, Intense, or Silent Mode (for discreet stretches). 

Only exercises in chosen category appear in deck. 

Persistent Local Storage: 

User preferences for frequency, difficulty, and exercise history saved using browser local storage. 

Repeat visits recall previous settings and last card drawn. 

Curated Exercise Database: 

Exercises stored as a local JSON file with fields for name, description, difficulty, and illustration. 

Easy to update or extend the exercise set. 

Responsive, Animated UI: 

Playful card animations (flip, shuffle, draw). 

Bright color palette: teal, yellow, pink. 

Layout adapts seamlessly to desktop and mobile screens. 

Exercise Actions: 

Draw a new card 

Repeat current exercise 

Skip (marks as skipped in session history)

3. User Journey 

First Visit: 

Welcome screen with app intro. 

Set preferred interval and difficulty. 

Option to preview exercises. 

Main Experience: 

See card deck and a “Draw Card” button. 

At set interval or on button press, an exercise card is presented. 

Animation makes card “deal” to user. 

Exercise Completion: 

Instructions and illustration clearly shown. 

Actions: repeat, skip, or draw another. 

Timer resets for next reminder. 

Session Persistence: 

App remembers last-used settings and exercise via local storage. 

User can review personal exercise history if desired.

4. Technical Requirements 

Framework: React (functional components, hooks) 

State Management: useState, useEffect; Context API or lightweight global state (if needed) 

Notification API: HTML5 browser notifications or in-app dialogs for reminders 

Storage: window.localStorage for settings, history 

Data Management: Exercises in local JSON, loaded at runtime 

Styling/Design: Styled with CSS-in-JS or CSS modules; matches vibrant mockup palette, playful animation
